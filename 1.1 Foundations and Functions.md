# Foundations and Functions

Sections 1.1.1 - 1.1.8

When we look at coding languages, there are two basic concepts involved. There is data, and there are processes that act on that data. For the most part, writing code is limited to creating the processes that act on data, though there are sometimes exceptions. The lines between them can also become blurry, where we treat a process as if it was the data behind it.

For example, getting the name of a person object is a function (process), but we would treat it as data in code.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(fName, lName) {
    this.fName = fName
    this.lName = lName
  }

  get name() {
    return this.fName + " " + this.lName
  }
}
```

## Elements of Programming Languages

For something to be a "usable" programming language, it must have a few properties:

1) Primitive Expressions
2) Tokens/Syntax
3) Means of Combining Expressions
4) Ways to Abstract Information

## Primitive Expressions

Primitive expressions are the smallest elements of a language that convey meaning. What expressions are actually primitives depend significantly on the language you are using. A primitive in machine code will be very different from one in JavaScript. Even higher-level languages will take something like a boolean and make it far more complex than a true or false value. For the purposes of this lesson, we'll consider data types like integers and booleans to be primitive expressions in addition to operators and constants.

## Tokens

It's worth noting that a primitive expression could be considered a theoretical concept, with tokens as the concrete implementation. For example, the keyword `const` in JavaScript tells the interpreter that what follows defines a constant- a name given to a value that does not change.

## Combining Expressions

A number by itself isn't practical. We need to be able to do stuff with that number to accomplish a task. So we combine expressions into statements that the interpreter can act on.

```javascript
1 + 3
  -> 4
```

`1`, `+`, and `3` are all primitive expressions, and the JS interpreter will automatically print the result when we input a statement like this one, so we don't need `console.log()` for now. As we did in math class, these combinations can be nested to create more complex code.

```javascript
(1 + 3) * (2  - 1)
  -> 4
```

While not the only way the interpreter handles scenarios like this, we can use a tree to look at how it might create the result with these simple structures.

### Conditionals

In addition to our basic math operators, there is one type I want to go into more detail about: conditionals. These are incredibly important since this is how we create branching logic- different behavior based on different inputs.

```javascript
const x = 1
x >= 0? x : -x
  -> 1

const x = -2
x >= 0? x : -x
  -> 2
```

There are a couple of ways to express conditionals in JS, but this lets us stick with an operator (`?` or the conditional operator) and its related expressions.

`<predicate expression> ? <concequent expression> : <alternative expression>`

The predicate needs to resolve to a boolean-- true or false. If true, the interpreter uses the expression after the question mark. If false, it runs the one after the colon.

As with other expressions, we can nest them, and this is how compound predicates using `&&`, `||`, and `!` are created.

```javascript
&& -> expression1 ? expression2 : false
|| -> expression1 ? true : expression2
! -> expresion1 ? false: true
```

( expression2 would be the second conditional)

If we step away from the fundamentals for a second, this breakdown also explains why we create null checks the way we do. These are checks that follow a format like

```javascript
items != null && items.count > 2 ? true : false
```

gets broken out into

```javascript
items != null ?
  items.count > 2 ? true : false // <- if the first expression is false then we don't run this and avoid an error
  : false
```

### Abstraction

If we always had to work with raw primitives, it would be tough to create complex code as we don't know what that data stands for, nor could we work with things like user input where we don't have the specific value while writing the code. Software requires abstraction where we can name things and use that name as a replacement for the item.

The simplest form of abstraction is constants, which name an expression so we can refer to it more easily. It's hard to tell what `4` means without any context, but `doggo_count` is something we can understand and work with. On the interpreter side, it introduces a need to point a name at a value in memory.

### Basic Functions

Functions are the second way to abstract information. It extends our ability to define constants as the results of an expression to name the expression itself, which can than be reused repeatedly.

`function <name> (<arguments>) { return <expression> }

```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x
}

square(2)
  -> 4

square(3)
  -> 9
```

Just as with any other expression, we can chain these together to expand what our code is capable of.

```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x
}

function sumOfSquares(x, y) {
  return square(x) + square(y)
}

sumOfSquares(2, 3)
  -> 13
```

We can also pass the output as an argument to another function.

```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x
}

function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y
}

sum(square(2), square(3))
  -> 13
```

A significant advantage of functions is what is called 'black box abstraction'. This is the idea that we can run a function to do something without knowing the contents of the function. We do this all the time with functions built into a language and will libraries. Few people dig into the code behind how `console.log` actually writes output to the console. We just assume that it will do that.

It also serves and important purpose in higher-order languages (this is most of the languages we work with today). A higher-order language allows functions to be used in arguments and return statements, not just their results.

```javascript
function square(x)
  return x * x
}

function abs(x) {
  return x >= 0? x : -x
}

function applyOperation(x, operation) {
  return operation(x)
}

applyOperation(-4, abs)
  -> 4

applyOperation(-4, square)
  -> 16
```
