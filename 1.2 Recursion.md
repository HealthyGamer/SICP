Recursion (n): See recursion. Also, a function that calls itself.

## Single Vs. Multiple Recursion

Single (Linear) Recursion: Recursive function calls itself once at most. O(n) or uses linear time and space. Often these could be replaced by a loop. Different languages will prefer loops or single recursion.

```javascript
function f(x) {
    if (x < 10) {
        return x
    }
    return f(x+1)
}
```

Multiple (Tree) Recursion: Recursive functions that call themselves more than once. Extremely useful for parsing through tree-like or other branching structures, but the runtime/memory usage can be exponential.

```javascript
function f(x) {
    if (x < 10) {
        return x
    }
    return f(x) + f(x+1) 
}
```

## Tail vs. Augmenting Recursion

Tail Recursion: The function call is the last thing the function does.

```javascript
function f(x) {
    if (x > 10) {
        return x
    }
    return f(x+1)
}
```

Augmenting Recursion: Some operation must be performed after the function call.

```javascript
function f(x) {
    if (x > 10) {
        return x
    }
    return  x * f(x+1) 
}
```

## Iterative vs. Recursive Process

Tail recursion is (usually) preferable since it also (usually) allows for an iterative process, whereas augmenting requires a recursive process.

Using the augmenting function from before, we can show a recursive process by substituting the function call for the return statement. We need to defer operations- calculate the recursive function call before the function can complete.

```javascript
function f(x) {
    if (x > 10) {
        return x
    }
    return  x * f(x+1) 
}
```

`f(4)` would build out to:

```javascript
f(4)
4 * f(5)
4 * (5 * f(6))
4 * (5 * (6 * f(7)))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * f(8))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * f(9)))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * (9 * f(10))))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * (9 * (10 * f(11)))))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * (9 * (10 * 11))))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * (9 * 110)))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * (8 * 990))))
4 * (5 * (6 * (7 * 7920)))
4 * (5 * (6 * 55440))
4 * (5 * 332640)
4 * 1663200
6652800
```

We can rewrite this function to use tail recursion and an iterative process to ensure we don't run out of memory holding all those nested functions.

```javascript
function f(x, product) {
    if (x > 10) {
        return x * product
    }
    return  f(x+1, x * product) 
}
```

Which results in a lot less space used:

```javascript
f(4, 1)
f(5, 4)
f(6, 20)
f(7, 120)
f(8, 840)
f(9, 6720)
f(10, 60480)
f(11, 604800)
6652800
```

## When to Use It

Most recursive functions could also be written as loops, and that's often the better choice. It forces us to write the code in a linear way that can be evaluated in a linear process and is easier to read.

We can rewrite the linear process above as a loop easily:

```javascript
function f(x) {
    let product = 1
    for(i = x; i <= 11; i ++) {
        product = product * i
    }
    return  product
}
```

However, when dealing with branching logic like searching through file folders or parsing HTML, recursion becomes much easier to read.

```javascript
function getElementById(node, id) {
    //is this the element we are looking for?
    if(node.id = id) {
        return node
    }

    for (const child of myElement.children) {
         branchNode = getElementById(child, id)
        
        //is the node somewhere in the child elements?
        if(branchNode) {
            return branchNode
        }
    }

    //an element with that ID wasn't found
    return
}

getElementById(window, "app")
```

It's worth noting that while it is important to apply recursion carefully, many language interpreters will attempt to "fix" functions that require a recursive process so that it will use the less expensive linear process.

When using recursion, there are a few things to check:

- Would it be easier to write this as a loop?
- How many times will the function call itself?
- If the answer to the previous question is unknown or could be large,  will this run as a recursive or linear process?
