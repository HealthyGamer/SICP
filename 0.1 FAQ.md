# FAQ

## What is This About?

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs was originally created as an intro level CS course in the 1980s. and is still being taught today- the third edition was published in 2022. It is less about how to write code, and more about how the computer reads it. As a dev, it's a little like learning grammar- a way to deepen our understanding of how programming languages work.

## How Much Coding Experience Do I Need?

SICP is an intro level CS course, so no coding knowledge is needed if you start near the beginning of the series and continue through. It's not the way I would recommend first learning to code unless you love theory- the series won't get you started with your first project like I do with my normal intro series. If there's a term I use or a concept you don't understand, ask! Someone will help you get back on track.

If you are an experienced dev, the concepts will be familiar, but this may be a different way of looking at code than you have used before. It may even solve a few mysteries of *why* we write code sometimes that doesn't make sense to humans.

## Do I Need to Attend Every Workshop?

As much as I can possibly manage, no. Discord just doesn't work that way. I will do my best to ensure each workshop is independant for those with prior coding knowledge. 

If you are a brand new dev, then it will be much harder to come in after the first few weeks or after missing a few lessons. I post course notes to help bridge those gaps, so if you are decent at self-study you may be able to catch up. 

If you have questions on what's covered in these notes, you can always ask for help.

## Will THere Be Homework/Do I Need to Study or Read Outside od Workshop Time?

Only if you want to. :)

I won't cover everything in the book. The [SourceAcademy site](https://sourceacademy.org/) has the full text of the book, exercises and a workspace freely available if you want dig in further.
