# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Where to Get the Book

You do not need the book to participate in the workshops- I use them as an outline and a source, this will not be run like a college class. However, since the 2nd edition is free from MIT, link below, you may find that useful as a supplement or on its own.

There are three editions of this textbook. What we will be doing in this series will pull material from the 2nd and 3rd (3rd being the JS edition). MIT Open Courseware has some materials for free if you would like to take advantage of them.

The first and second editions use LISP, which while well suited to this topic, not many devs are familiar with it. Any code we discuss will be in JS or psuedocode similar to JS.

- Video lectures from the 1st edition, which is reasonably similar to the 2nd: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
