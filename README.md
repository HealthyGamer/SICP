# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Where to Get the Book

You do not need the book to participate in the workshops- I use them as an outline and a source, this will not be run like a college class. However, both the second and third editions of the book are licensed under Creative Commons, with links below. Video lectures from the first edition is also available from MIT Open Courseware.

The first and second editions use LISP, while the third was rewritten in JavaScript. Since the 3rd edition also has more up to date terminology, that's the one I'll be using as a source.
