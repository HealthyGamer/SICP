# Data Structures - Trees

## What are data trees?

### Definition of trees

A tree is a way of organizing data that arranges it into a tree-like structure. It consists of nodes, which represent information or data points, and edges, which represent the connections between those nodes. The tree has a single root node, the topmost node, and each node can have zero or more child nodes.

### Nodes and edges

Each node on a tree is space, usually represented by an object, that can hold two types of information. It may contain data and reference other nodes called edges or branches in the tree. Some specific types of trees will create rules on whether a node can have edges and data or how many edges a node can have. For example, a binary tree is one where nodes have no more than two edges each.

There are a couple special nodes in the tree:

- The root node is the entry point to the rest of the tree.
- Leaves are nodes with no child nodes- the end of a particular branch.

## Advantages of using data trees

Data trees improve data organization by providing a hierarchical structure that allows for easy categorization and grouping of data.

- Categorization and sub-categorization: In a data tree, each node can have multiple child nodes, allowing easy categorization and sub-categorization of data. This makes it easy to organize related data into logical categories.
- Consistent structure: The hierarchical structure of a data tree provides a consistent and uniform system for organizing data. This structure makes it easy to understand and navigate the data, even as the data set grows larger.
- Easy to visualize: Data trees are easy to visualize, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships in the data, which can lead to insights and improved decision-making.
- Scalability: Data trees are scalable, which means they can handle large and complex data sets. As the data set grows, new nodes can be added to the tree to accommodate the additional data without affecting the tree's overall structure.
- Faster search times: Each node has a unique path from the root to the leaf node. This path provides a unique identifier for the data stored in the leaf node. Search algorithms can retrieve the data faster than searching through a list or an unstructured data set.
- Easy to add, remove, and modify data: Data trees make it easy to add, remove, or modify data in the tree without affecting the rest of the data structure. Because each node only has one parent, adding or removing a node does not require modifying other nodes in the tree. This means that data can be updated quickly and easily without requiring a full search of the data set.

## Limitations of data trees

While data trees offer many advantages, there are also some limitations to consider.

- Limited flexibility: Data trees are hierarchical structures, which means they are best suited for organizing data with a clear hierarchical relationship. For example, if there are many-to-many relationships between data points, a data tree may not be the best way to represent the data.
- Inefficient for sparse data: Data trees can be ineffective for sparse data sets with significant gaps between the nodes. In these cases, the tree can become unbalanced, slowing down the search algorithm and making data retrieval less efficient.
- Memory or storage limitations: In some cases, data trees can require a lot of memory to store and manage the data structure. In some cases, trees are used in a way that requires multiple copies of the same data

## Real-world examples of data trees

### File systems

The file system on a computer is a simple example of a tree structure without too many rules. The drive acts as a root node. From there, you have two types of nodes- folders and files. Folders can have edges but no data and files are always leaves- data with no outgoing branches. There aren't any other built-in rules on top of that other than what is required for the software to find things.

### HTML

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>My Webpage</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <header>
         <h1>Welcome to my Webpage</h1>
         <nav>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
         </nav>
      </header>
      <main>
         <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is John, and I love programming!</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="#">Project 1</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Project 2</a></li>
            </ul>
         </section>
      </main>
      <footer>
         <p>&copy; 2023 My Webpage</p>
      </footer>
   </body>
</html>
```

HTML is almost the complete opposite of file systems regarding rules. Nodes have data and edges, but there are rules about their order and how they interact.

For example, we must have a `<ol>` or `<ul>` node when creating a list. Inside that are `<li>` nodes. A modern browser can deal with `<li>` nodes that don't have `<ol>` or `<ul>` as a parent, but it won't work quite right.

### SQL Database Engines

In many database engines, indexes are structures that retrieve data more quickly. Like an index in a book, the engine can use the index to search swiftly through an organized subset of data to find the necessary information. They also use a concept called pages to manage information. They are chunks of data with a fixed size that make it easier for the engine to create pointers. You can relate this to books as well. A page in a physical book is a fixed size that can hold limited information. Each page has a page number you can use to quickly find a specific section of a book.

When an index is created on a table, the index structure is built using a B-tree. Each node contains pointers to other nodes or to the data pages that contain the indexed data. When a query is executed against an indexed table, the database engine uses the index structure to quickly locate the data that matches the query criteria.

Many SQL engines also allow for 'included' columns in addition to the indexed column. A database with an "Employees" table will probably have some form of ID column to create a unique identifier for each employee. Since many lookups will be based on that ID, indexing that column is standard practice. The server will create a tree of IDs to quickly find a specific row with a pointer to the page where the rest of the data lives.

```text
                                 50
                        /                \
                     20                   80
               /           \          /        \
             10             30     60         100
           /      \       /      \    /   \       /   \
          5       15    25      35  55  70  90   110 120
        /  \     /  \   /  \    / \
       2    7  12  18  22  27  32  38
```

If the lookup usually returns a few specific columns, like first and last name, that data can be included on the tree with the ID index. That way, a request to get an employee's name based on ID can use only that index- it doesn't need to go to the page with the rest of the data. In the real world, if that ID is an integer, it will probably be set as a clustered index (the specific term varies by engine). The clustered index represents the order that the table is written into storage. 

Each index comes with a cost- each additional copy of the data takes up disk space and must be updated along with the rest of the data in the table. If I have a table with three indexes, then any changes to a row require updates to four different locations, not just one.
